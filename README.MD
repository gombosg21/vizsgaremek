It *is* indeed a web-server and a SPA frontend bundled together.

## Technical Implementation

Backend uses Express in **Community Edition** Node.js
DB is *MySQL* provided by a MariaDB engine.
Connectivity between the server and DB is thru mysql2/Sequelize ORM.

The framework of our choice is **Angular**
