# About
## Concept
VisualStory is a Programming Technicans School final exam project.
Its basically an Instagram-copy, albeit less sophisticated.
It *is* indeed a web-server and a SPA frontend bundled together.

## Technical Implementation
### Backend
Backend uses Express in **Community Edition** Node.js
DB is *MySQL* provided by a MariaDB engine.
Connectivity between the server and DB is thru mysql2/Sequelize ORM.
Tests provided by **jest**

### Frontend
As for most frontends language is js too.
The framework of our choice is **Angular**
